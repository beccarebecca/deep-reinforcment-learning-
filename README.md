# deep-reinforcment-learning-
Cartpole deep reinforcement learning project.
This is a deep learning assignment I have completed. It uses a basic feed-forward network with normal backpropagation to update weights.
The assignment is to train using a combination of reinforcemnt, and machine learning to approve performace.
The libraries I used are the python, gym,  keras (deep learning) ,and numpy for matix manipulation ( dot products, transforms, and help with derivitive caculations required by  the Keras library.
